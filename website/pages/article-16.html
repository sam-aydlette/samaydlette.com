            <h2>On Jen Easterly and Military Values</h2>
            
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>I've been thinking a lot about the implications of former Director of CISA and Army veteran Jen Easterly having her offer to teach at West Point <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/harder-right-jen-easterly-hi1be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescinded</a> for political reasons. I can't put it better than her when she called it a "casually manufactured outrage that drowned out the quiet labor of truth and the steady pulse of integrity."</p>

                <p>I understand what she means. I normally avoid politics and stick to technical topics, but I decided to make an exception and share how I feel on this one.</p>

                <p>For decades, the U.S. military has positioned itself as the defender of American values such as democracy and freedom. Some would probably disagree, and there are certainly valid criticisms, but in general the perception has been that the U.S. military is a global force for good. That people around the world perceive the American military as the "good guys" is important for many reasons. This perception is what is currently being undone, and it has far reaching implications.</p>

                <p>Jen Easterly's offer to teach at West Point being rescinded aligns with a broader narrative that undermines what the U.S. Military stands for. For example, the rebranding of the Department of Defense to the Department of War trivializes the American military into an indifferent instrument of power, when it is so much more than that.</p>

                <p>Having participated in the War in Iraq, I fully understand the moral ambiguities of war. Despite my experiences, I still believe that as long as the civilian leadership at the top are committed to integrity, the U.S. military is fundamentally a mission-focused, values-driven organization that provides security and stability across an incredibly complex geopolitical landscape. For example, the U.S. Navy protects global shipping lanes. That is a good thing.</p>

                <p>Military service members sacrifice a lot for this to remain true. They spend long deployments away from their families. They struggle with trauma related to violence experienced both in combat and in other ways. They have friends and loved ones who have been killed.</p>

                <p>Military personnel accept these sacrifices because they care about the mission. While the military can serve as a solid path for achieving upward mobility, there are many easier and less stressful ways to make money. Young recruits still feel a surge of pride when they put on the uniform for the first time. It isn't all just a marketing gimmick. For many people who have served and their families, it's real.</p>

                <p>We all depend on our military to protect us. There are a lot of things in our society that need fixing, but it could still be worse. If we forget that we might lose the good things we still have. We should speak in defense of Jen Easterly because even if we don't agree with her politics (frankly I have no idea what they are, and don't care) or even oppose her leadership as CISA Director, she and everyone else who swore an oath and upheld it honorably to the best of their ability should be given respect. To do otherwise is displays ungratefulness to military service and the values that a lot of us still believe in.</p>
