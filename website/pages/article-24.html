                    <p>I wrote my latest article &ldquo;Living at the Threshold&rdquo; with the help of AI. But then I re-read it, and re-read it, and it was boring. There is nothing wrong with it per se, except this &ldquo;je na se pais&rdquo; that felt inauthentic. The world is going haywire right now and we can all feel it I think. At least I can. It feels like we are all living at the threshold of something very, very big. We are right there, at the threshold, but we haven&rsquo;t crossed over yet, and the suspense is hard to bear. We don&rsquo;t know if there will be terror or jubilation on the other side. Although again, the &ldquo;jubilation&rdquo; possibility feels a bit off. Icky. Inauthentic in a way that is hard to pin down. Like my article was.</p>

                    <p>I did learn a lot from AI while preparing the article. I refreshed my memory around vectors and matrixes, and then learned about eigenvalues. This is genuinely exciting for me, as it gives me a mathematical vocabulary that maps directly to the direction that FedRAMP 20x is heading. I was able to pull the thread further and understand connections to physics that, while eluding my full comprehension, seem tantalizingly close to a theory that explains a lot of mysterious things. The observer paradox (i.e., Shrodinger&rsquo;s cat), quantum entanglement (i.e., spooky action at a distance), and many other intractable problems are explainable via a narrative that makes sense and follows Occam&rsquo;s razor. The process of discovery was a lot of fun, and I wanted to share that with others, hence the article and deep dive.</p>

                    <p>But after I published it, it felt weird. It didn&rsquo;t feel like me. My LinkedIn post felt like I was promoting something that wasn&rsquo;t entirely mine. So I decided to write my current thoughts &ldquo;old school&rdquo; with just me and a keyboard, and this is what came out.</p>

                    <p>We can use mathematics to formalize risk management in ways that produce tangible outcomes. I believe that adopting eigenvalue measurements to map proximity to thresholds is likely to be a very effective way to do that, so long as the measurements are based on a solid foundation of actual, raw system telemetry data that is contextualized via a transparent policy layer into leading indicators. I don&rsquo;t have any case studies that eigenvalues will add value, or even a viable proof of concept. It&rsquo;s just an idea that is worth exploring. And I intend to keep exploring it. But I am going to be more careful to use my blog and my words to connect with others authentically. I&rsquo;m truly not sure what that even means anymore. Hopefully my readers will continue to extend grace as I stumble along, learning as I go.</p>
